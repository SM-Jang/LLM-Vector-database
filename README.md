# LLM-Vector-database

"Don't fine-tune your LLM, **Construct** a vector database."

## Overview

LLM-Vector-database is a powerful tool that allows you to construct a vector database using sentence embeddings. Instead of fine-tuning your Large Language Model (LLM), this project provides a unique approach to natural language processing and understanding. By embedding sentences into a vector space and constructing a database from these vectors, you can generate text responses based on this database. This makes it an ideal resource for chatbot development and other natural language processing applications.

## Features

- Sentence embedding: Convert your sentences into vector representations.
- Vector database construction: Build a database from your sentence vectors.
- Text generation: Generate text responses based on the vector database.
